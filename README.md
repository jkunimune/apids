# apids
a totally original spelling game

Each game chooses seven letters, one of which is highlighted. The players must find all English words of at least four letters that
are made with the center letter and some combination of the others. Word list comes from [SCOWL](https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist),
plus some scraping on my part.
